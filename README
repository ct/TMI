NAME
    TMI - Slice and Dice weight values

VERSION
    Version 1.0

SYNOPSIS
    Take a list of weights, slice and dice those bad boys.

    Assumes a MySQL database named "tmi" having a table called "weights"
    with two columns, an AUTO_INCREMENT weightsID and a float called weight.

SUBROUTINES
  new()
        my $tmi = TMI->new(dbuser=>'user', dbpass=>'pass');

    or

        my $tmi = TMI->new(dbuser=>'user', dbpass=>'pass', startrec=>100);

    to start counting from day 100. dbuser and dbpass are mandatory.

  weights()
    Returns an arrayref containing all of the weights in the selected range.

  totaldays()
    Returns a value indicating how many days/records were pulled from the
    database.

  totaldeltas()
    Returns a value indicating how many weight changes, which is totaldays -
    1, since day 1 is a point, not a delta.

  firstweight()
    Returns a value indicating first/earliest weight of values pulled.

  lastweight()
    Returns a value indicating last/newest weight of values pulled.

  lastloss()
    Returns a value indicating last days weight loss. If called with any
    true value as an argument, it will wrap any positive deltas in an html
    span with bold red text.

        $last = $tmi->lastloss(1);

    Would return

        <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold;">+1</span>

    If the lastloss value is +1.

  totalloss()
    Returns a value indicating weight lost over the entire range of pulled
    values.

  percentloss()
    Returns a value indicating weight lost over the entire range of pulled
    values as a percentage of the earliest weight in the range.

  percentloss()
    Returns a value indicating weight lost over the entire range of pulled
    values as a percentage of the earliest weight in the range.

  avglosstotal()
    Returns a value indicating average daily loss across entire range of
    pulled values.

  avglossrange()
    Returns a value indicating average daily loss across a specific range of
    pulled values.

        $avg = $tmi->avglossrange(10);

    Would give the average daily loss over the last ten days.

    If no range is specified the range defaults to 14 days.

    If the requested range is greater than the total number of records, all
    days averaged.

  weightdaysago()
    Returns a value indicating recorded weight a specific number of days
    ago. If no argument is specified a default of 14 days is used.

  daystovalue()
    Returns a value indicating how many days it will take to reach a target
    weight.

        $days = $tmi->daystovalue($targetweight,$range);

    If no targetweight is specified, an error will be thrown.

    The $range argument specified a value for "using the average daily loss
    over the last $range days". If this value is not supplied it will
    default to 14.

  daystodelta()
        $days = $tmi->daystodelta($targetweight,$range);

    Returns a value indicating how many days it will take to reach a
    specified weight $targetweight lower than the last/current weight.

    If no targetweight is specified, an error will be thrown.

    The $range argument specified a value for "using the average daily loss
    over the last $range days". If this value is not supplied it will
    default to 14.
